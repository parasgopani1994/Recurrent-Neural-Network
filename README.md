# Recurrent-Neural-Network
This repository contains practice notebooks for developing a basic RNN and LSTM model as taught in Coursera course - Sequence Models by Andrew Ng. 
A Recurrent Neural Network is developed with one time steps first and then iterated over Tx time steps. This model will learn the structure of words in a sentence.
